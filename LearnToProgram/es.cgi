      When you program a computer, you have to "speak" in a
      language your computer understands:  a programming
      language.  There are lots and lots of different
      languages out there, and many of them are excellent.
      In this tutorial I chose to use my favorite
      programming language, <em>Ruby</em>.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Aside from being my favorite,
      Ruby is also the easiest programming language I have seen
      (and I've seen quite a few).  In fact, that's the real
      reason I'm writing this tutorial:  I didn't decide to write
      a tutorial, and then choose Ruby because it's my favorite;
      instead, I found Ruby to be so easy that I decided there
      really ought to be a good beginner's tutorial which uses
      it.  It's Ruby's simplicity which prompted this tutorial,
      not the fact that it's my favorite.
      (Writing a similar tutorial using
      another language, like C++ or Java, would have required
      hundreds and hundreds of pages.)  But don't think that
      Ruby is a beginner's language just because it is easy!
      It is a powerful, professional-strength programming
      language if ever there was one.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      When you write something in a human language, what is
      written is called text.  When you write something in a computer
      language, what is written is called <dfn>code</dfn>.  I
      have included lots of examples of Ruby code throughout
      this tutorial, most of them complete programs you can
      run on your own computer.  To make the code easier to
      read, I have colored parts of the code different
      colors.  (For example, numbers are always
      <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">#{@@NUMBER_COLOR}</span></span>.)
      Anything you are supposed to type in will be in a
      #{input @@INPUT_DESC}, and anything a program prints
      out will be in a #{output @@OUTPUT_DESC}.

      If you come across something you don't understand, or you
      have a question which wasn't answered, write it down and
      keep reading!  It's quite possible that the answer will
      come in a later chapter.  However, if your question was
      not answered by the last chapter, I will tell you where
      you can go to ask it.  There are lots of wonderful people
      out there more than willing to help; you just need to know
      where they are.

      But first we need to download and install Ruby onto your

    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The Windows installation of Ruby is a breeze.  First, you
      need to download the
      <a href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/">Ruby installer</a>.
      There might be a couple of versions to choose from; this tutorial
      is using version #{RUBY_VERSION}, so make sure what you download is at
      least as recent as that.  (I would just get the latest
      version available.)  Then simply run the installation program.
      It will ask you where you want to install Ruby.  Unless you have
      a good reason for it, I would just install it in the default
      location.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      In order to program, you need to be able to write programs and
      to run programs.  To do this, you will need a text editor and a
      command line.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The Ruby installer comes with a lovely text editor called SciTE
      (the Scintilla Text Editor).  You can run SciTE by selecting it
      from the start menu.  If you would like your code to be colored
      like the examples in this tutorial, download these files and
      put them in your SciTE folder (<kbd>c:/ruby/scite</kbd> if you chose the
      default location):
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    ul do
      li {'<a href="'+LINKADDR+'SciTEGlobal.properties">Global Properties</a>'}
      li {'<a href="'+LINKADDR+'ruby.properties">Ruby Properties</a>'}
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      It would also be a good idea to create a folder somewhere to keep
      all of your programs.  Make sure that when you save a program,
      you save it into this folder.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      To get to your command line, select Command Prompt from the
      Accessories folder in your start menu.  You will want to
      navigate to the folder where you are keeping your programs.
      Typing #{input 'cd ..'} will take you up one folder, and
      #{input 'cd foldername'} would put you inside the folder
      named <kbd>foldername</kbd>.  To see all of the folders
      in your current folder, type #{input 'dir /ad'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH

      In order to program, you need to be able to write programs and

      For a text editor, you can use whatever one you are familiar
      or comfortable with.  If you use TextEdit, however, make sure
      you save your programs as text-only!  Otherwise your programs
      <em>will not work</em>.  Other options for programming are
      emacs, vi, and pico, which are all accessible from the
      command line.

      already.  Type #{input 'which ruby'}.  If it says something like
      #{output '/usr/bin/which: no ruby in (...)'}, then you need to
      <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20020102.html">download Ruby</a>,
      otherwise see what version of Ruby you are running with
      #{input 'ruby -v'}.  If it is older than the latest stable build
      on the above download page, you might want to upgrade.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      If you are the root user, then you probably don't need any
      instructions for installing Ruby.  If you aren't, you might want

      everyone on that system could use Ruby.)

      <kbd>ruby-1.6.7.tar.gz</kbd>, you can open it with
      #{input 'tar zxvf ruby-1.6.7.tar.gz'}.  Change directory
      to the directory you just created (in this example,
      #{input 'cd ruby-1.6.7'}).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Configure your installation by typing
      #{input './configure --prefix=$HOME'}).  Next type
      #{input 'make'}, which will build your Ruby interpreter.
      This might take a few minutes.  After that is done, type
      #{input 'make install'} to install it.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH

      Hmmm... un mensaje de error.  El problema es eque en realidad
      no puedes sumar un n√∫mero a una cadena, o multiplicar 
      una cadena por otra cadena. No tiene m√°s sentido que esto:

      Algo m√°s para tener cuidado: Puedes escribir #{code "'pig'*5"} en un programa,
      dado que s√≥lo siognifica #{code '5'} conjuntos de la cadena #{code "'pig'"} todo 
      sumado. De cualquier modo, 
      tu <em>no puedes</em> escribir #{code "5*'pig'"}, ya que eso significa #{code "'pig'"}
      conjuntos de el n√∫mero #{code '5'}, lo cual es simplemente tonto.

      Finalmente, y si quisieras que tu programa imprimiera

    end
    prog false do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'You're swell!'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Bueno, <em>eso</em> no funcionar√°; No intentar√© ni ejecutarlo.
      La computadora pens√≥ que hab√≠amos terminado con la cadena. 
      (Esta es la raz√≥n de porque es lindo tener un editor de 
      texto que haga <dfn>coloreo sint√°ctico</dfn> por ti.)
      ¬øEntonces c√≥mo permitimos que la computadora sepa que
      queremos permanecer en la cadena? Tenemos que <dfn>escapar</dfn>
      el apostrofe, de esta manera:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'You\\'re swell!'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      La barra invertida es le caracter de escape. En otras palabras, 
      si tu tienes una barra invertida y otro caracter, ellos a veces son
      convertidos a otro caracter. Las √∫nicas cosas que una barra invertida
      escapa son los apostrofes y las propias barras invertidas. (Si lo 
      piensas un poco, los caracteres escapadas siempre se escapan a s√≠ mismo).
      Unos pocos ejemplos vendr√≠an muy bien, me parece:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'You\\'re swell!'
      puts 'barra invertida al final de la cadena:  \\\\'
      puts 'arriba\\\\abajo'
      puts 'arriba\\abajo'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Dado que la barra invertida <em>no</em> escapa un #{code "'d'"},
      pero <em>si</em> si se escapa a si misma, esos dos √∫ltimos caracteres
      son id√©nticos. No parecen lo mismo en el c√≥digo, pero en tu computadora
      son realmente los mismos.

      So far, whenever we have #{code 'puts'}ed a string or a number, the thing
      we #{code 'puts'}ed is gone.  What I mean is, if we wanted to print
      something out twice, we would have to type it in twice:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts '...you can say that again...'
      puts '...you can say that again...'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      It would be nice if we could just type it in once and then hang on to it...
      store it somewhere.
      Well, we can, of course&mdash;otherwise, I wouldn't have brought it up!
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      To store the string in your computer's memory, we need to
      give the string a name.  Programmers often refer to this process
      as <dfn>assignment</dfn>,
      and they call the names <dfn>variables</dfn>.  This variable can be just
      about any sequence of letters and numbers, but the first character
      needs to be a lowercase letter.  Let's try that last program again,
      but this time I will give the string the name #{code 'myString'} (though I could
      just as well have named it #{code 'str'} or
      #{code 'myOwnLittleString'} or #{code 'henryTheEighth'}).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      myString = '...you can say that again...'
      puts myString
      puts myString
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Whenever you tried to do something to #{code 'myString'}, the program did it
      to #{code "'...you can say that again...'"} instead.  You can think of the
      variable #{code 'myString'} as "pointing to" the string
      #{code "'...you can say that again...'"}.  Here's a slightly more interesting example:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      name = 'Patricia Rosanna Jessica Mildred Oppenheimer'
      puts 'My name is ' + name + '.'
      puts 'Wow!  ' + name + ' is a really long name!'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Also, just as we can <em>assign</em> an object to a variable,
      we can <em>reassign</em> a different object to that variable.
      (This is why we call them variables:  because what they
      point to can vary.)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      composer = 'Mozart'
      puts composer + ' was "da bomb", in his day.'
      
      composer = 'Beethoven'
      puts 'But I prefer ' + composer + ', personally.'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Of course, variables can point to any kind of object, not just strings:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      var = 'just another ' + 'string'
      puts var
      
      var = 5 * (1+2)
      puts var
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      In fact, variables can point to just about anything...
      except other variables.
      So what happens if we try?
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      var1 = 8
      var2 = var1
      puts var1
      puts var2
      
      puts ''
      
      var1 = 'eight'
      puts var1
      puts var2
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So first, when we tried to point #{code 'var2'} to #{code 'var1'}, it really
      pointed to #{code '8'} instead (just like #{code 'var1'}
      was pointing to).  Then we had #{code 'var1'} point to
      #{code "'eight'"}, but since #{code 'var2'} was never really
      pointing at #{code 'var1'}, it stays pointing at #{code '8'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end

      the next thing we want to do is to get them all to play nicely together.
      END_PARAGRAPH

      We've seen that if we want a program to print #{output '25'}, the following

    end

      puts var1 + var2

    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Part of the problem is that your computer doesn't know if you
      were trying to get #{output '7'} (#{code '2 + 5'}), or if you wanted
      to get #{output '25'} (#{code "'2' + '5'"}).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Before we can add these together, we need some way of getting the
      string version of #{code 'var1'}, or to get the integer version
      of #{code 'var2'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Conversions'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      To get the string version of an object, we simply write
      #{code '.to_s'} after it:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      var1 = 2
      var2 = '5'
      
      puts var1.to_s + var2
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Similarly, #{code 'to_i'} gives the integer version of an object,
      and #{code 'to_f'} gives the float version.  Let's look at what
      these three methods do (and <em>don't</em> do) a little more closely:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      var1 = 2
      var2 = '5'
      
      puts var1.to_s + var2
      puts var1 + var2.to_i
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Notice that, even after we got the string version of
      #{code 'var1'} by calling #{code 'to_s'}, #{code 'var1'} was always pointing
      at #{code '2'}, and never at #{code "'2'"}.  Unless we explicitly reassign
      #{code 'var1'} (which requires an #{code '='} sign), it will point
      at #{code '2'} for the life of the program.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Now let's try some more interesting (and a few just weird) conversions:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts '15'.to_f
      puts '99.999'.to_f
      puts '99.999'.to_i
      puts ''
      puts '5 is my favorite number!'.to_i
      puts 'Who asked you about 5 or whatever?'.to_i
      puts 'Your momma did.'.to_f
      puts ''
      puts 'stringy'.to_s
      puts 3.to_i
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So, this probably gave some surprises.  The first one is pretty
      standard, giving #{output '15.0'}.
      After that, we converted the string #{code "'99.999'"} to a float and
      to an integer.  The float did what we expected; the integer was, as always, rounded down.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Next, we had some examples of some... <em>unusual</em> strings being converted
      into numbers.  #{code 'to_i'} ignores the first thing it doesn't understand,
      and the rest of the string from that point on.  So the first one
      was converted to #{code '5'}, but the others, since they started with
      letters, were ignored completely... so the computer just picks zero.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Finally, we saw that our last two conversions did nothing at all,
      just as we would expect.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Another Look at '+(code 'puts')}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      There's something strange about our favorite method...  Take a look at this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 20
      puts 20.to_s
      puts '20'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Why do these three all print the same thing?  Well, the last two
      should, since #{code '20.to_s'} <em>is</em> #{code "'20'"}.  But what
      about the first one, the integer #{code '20'}?  For that matter, what
      does it even mean to write out <em>the integer</em> 20?  When
      you write a <em>2</em> and then a <em>0</em> on a piece of paper, you
      are writing down a string, not an integer.  <em>The integer</em> 20 is the number of
      fingers and toes I have; it isn't a <em>2</em> followed by a <em>0</em>.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Well, here's the big secret behind our friend, #{code 'puts'}:  Before
      #{code 'puts'} tries to write out an object, it uses #{code 'to_s'} to
      get the string version of that object.  In fact, the <em>s</em> in
      #{code 'puts'} stands for <em>string</em>; #{code 'puts'} really means
      <dfn>put string</dfn>.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      This may not seem too exciting now, but there are many,
      <em>many</em> kinds of objects in Ruby (you'll even learn how
      to make your own!), and it's nice to know what will happen if
      you try to #{code 'puts'} a really weird object,
      like a picture of your grandmother, or a music file or something.
      But that will come later...
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      In the meantime, we have a few more methods for you, and they
      allow us to write all sorts of fun programs...
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'The Methods '+(code 'gets')+' and '+(code 'chomp')}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      If #{code 'puts'} means <dfn>put string</dfn>, I'm sure you can guess
      what #{code 'gets'} stands for.  And just as #{code 'puts'} always
      spits out strings, #{code 'gets'} will only retrieve strings.  And
      whence does it get them?
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      From you!  Well, from your keyboard, anyway.  Since your keyboard only
      makes strings, that works out beautifully.  What actually happens
      is that #{code 'gets'} just sits there, reading what you type until
      you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  Let's try it out:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Is there an echo in here?'] do <<-END_CODE
      puts gets
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Of course, whatever you type in will just get repeated back
      to you.  Run it a few times and try typing in different things.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Now we can make interactive programs!  In this one, type in
      your name and it will greet you:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Chris'], '<em>Eek!</em>  I just ran it&mdash;I typed in my name, and this is what happened:' do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello there, and what\\'s your name?'
      name = gets
      puts 'Your name is ' + name + '?  What a lovely name!'
      puts 'Pleased to meet you, ' + name + '.  :)'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Hmmm... it looks like when I typed in the letters <kbd>C</kbd>,
      <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>r</kbd>, <kbd>i</kbd>,
      <kbd>s</kbd>, and then pressed <kbd>Enter</kbd>, #{code 'gets'}
      got all of the letters in my name <em>and</em> the
      <kbd>Enter</kbd>!  Fortunately, there's a method just for
      this sort of thing:  #{code 'chomp'}.  It takes off any <kbd>Enter</kbd>s
      hanging out at the end of your string.  Let's try that program again,
      but with #{code 'chomp'} to help us this time:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Chris'] do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello there, and what\\'s your name?'
      name = gets.chomp
      puts 'Your name is ' + name + '?  What a lovely name!'
      puts 'Pleased to meet you, ' + name + '.  :)'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Much better!  Notice that since #{code 'name'} is pointing to
      #{code 'gets.chomp'}, we don't ever have to say
      #{code 'name.chomp'};  #{code 'name'} was already
      #{code 'chomp'}ed.

      So far we've seen a number of different methods,
      #{code 'puts'} and #{code 'gets'}
      and so on (<em><strong>Pop Quiz:</strong>  List all
      of the methods we have seen so far!
      There are ten of them; the answer is below.</em>),
      but we haven't really talked about what methods are.
      We know what they do, but
      we don't know what they are.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      But really, that <em>is</em> what they are:  things
      that do stuff.  If objects (like strings,
      integers, and floats) are the nouns in the Ruby
      language, then methods are like the verbs.
      And, just like in English, you can't have a
      verb without a noun to <em>do</em> the verb.
      For example, ticking isn't something that just
      happens; a clock (or a watch or something)
      has to do it.  In English we would say, "The
      clock ticks."  In Ruby we would say
      #{code 'clock.tick'} (assuming that #{code 'clock'}
      was a Ruby object, of course).
      Programmers might say we were "calling #{code 'clock'}'s
      #{code 'tick'} method,"
      or that we "called #{code 'tick'} on #{code 'clock'}."
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So, did you take the quiz?  Good.  Well, I'm
      sure you remembered the methods
      #{code 'puts'}, #{code 'gets'}, and #{code 'chomp'},
      since we just covered those.
      You probably also got our conversion methods,
      #{code 'to_i'}, #{code 'to_f'},
      and #{code 'to_s'}.  However, did you get
      the other four?  Why, it's none other
      than our old arithmetic buddies #{code '+'},
      #{code '-'}, #{code '*'}, and #{code '/'}!
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So as I was saying, just as every verb needs
      a noun, so every method needs an object.
      It's usually easy to tell which object is
      performing the method:  it's what comes right
      before the dot, like in our #{code 'clock.tick'}
      example, or in #{code '101.to_s'}.
      Sometimes, however, it's not quite as
      obvious; like with the arithmetic methods.  As
      it turns out, #{code '5 + 5'} is really
      just a shortcut way of writing #{code '5.+ 5'}.
      For example:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'hello '.+ 'world'
      puts (10.* 9).+ 9
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      It isn't very pretty, so we won't ever write
      it like that; however, it's important to
      understand what is <em>really</em> happening.
      (On my machine, that also gives me a <dfn>warning</dfn>:
      #{output 'warning: parenthesize argument(s) for future version'}.
      It still ran the code just fine, but it's telling me that
      it's having trouble figuring out what I mean, and to use
      more parentheses in the future.)
      This also gives us a deeper understanding
      of why we can do #{code "'pig'*5"} but we
      can't do #{code "5*'pig'"}:  #{code "'pig'*5"} is
      telling #{code "'pig'"} to do the multiplying,
      but #{code "5*'pig'"} is telling #{code '5'}
      to do the multiplying.  #{code "'pig'"} knows how
      to make #{code '5'} copies of itself and
      add them all together; however, #{code '5'}
      will have a much more difficult time of making
      #{code "'pig'"} copies of <em>itself</em>
      and adding them together.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And, of course, we still have #{code 'puts'}
      and #{code 'gets'} to explain.  Where are their
      objects?  In English, you can sometimes leave
      out the noun; for example, if a villain
      yells "Die!", the implicit noun is whoever
      he is yelling at.  In Ruby, if I say
      #{code "puts 'to be or not to be'"}, what
      I am really saying is
      #{code "self.puts 'to be or not to be'"}.
      So what is #{code 'self'}?  It's a special variable
      which points to whatever object you are in.
      We don't even know how to be <em>in</em>
      an object yet, but until we find out, we
      are always going to be in a big object which
      is... the whole program!  And lucky for us,
      the program has a few methods of its own,
      like #{code 'puts'} and #{code 'gets'}.
      Watch this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      iCantBelieveIMadeAVariableNameThisLongJustToPointToA3 = 3
      puts iCantBelieveIMadeAVariableNameThisLongJustToPointToA3
      self.puts iCantBelieveIMadeAVariableNameThisLongJustToPointToA3
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      If you didn't entirely follow all of that,
      that's OK.  The important thing to take away from
      all of this is that every method is being
      done by some object, even if it doesn't have
      a dot in front of it.  If you understand
      that, then you're all set.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Fancy String Methods'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Let's learn a few fun string methods.  You don't
      have to memorize them all; you can
      just look up this page again if you forget
      them.  I just want to show you a <em>small</em>
      part of what strings can do.  In fact, I
      can't remember even half of the string methods myself&mdash;but
      that's fine, because there are great references
      on the internet with all of the string
      methods listed and explained.  (I will show
      you where to find them at the end of this tutorial.)
      Really, I don't even <em>want</em> to know
      all the string methods; it's kind of like knowing every
      word in the dictionary.  I can speak English
      just fine without knowing every word in
      the dictionary... and isn't that really the whole
      point of the dictionary?  So you don't <em>have</em>
      to know what's in it?
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So, our first string method is #{code 'reverse'},
      which gives a backwards version of a string:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      var1 = 'stop'
      var2 = 'stressed'
      var3 = 'Can you pronounce this sentence backwards?'
      
      puts var1.reverse
      puts var2.reverse
      puts var3.reverse
      puts var1
      puts var2
      puts var3
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      As you can see, #{code 'reverse'} doesn't reverse the
      original string; it just makes
      a new backwards version of it.  That's why #{code 'var1'}
      is still #{code "'stop'"}
      even after we called #{code 'reverse'} on #{code 'var1'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Another string method is #{code 'length'}, which tells
      us the number of characters (including
      spaces) in the string:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Christopher David Pine'] do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'What is your full name?'
      name = gets.chomp
      puts 'Did you know there are ' + name.length + ' characters in your name, ' + name + '?'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Uh-oh!  Something went wrong, and it looks like it happened sometime after the line
      #{code 'name = gets.chomp'}...  Do you see the problem?  See if you can figure it out.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The problem is with #{code 'length'}:  it gives us a number, but we want a string.  Easy enough,
      we'll just throw in a #{code 'to_s'} (and cross our fingers):
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Christopher David Pine'] do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'What is your full name?'
      name = gets.chomp
      puts 'Did you know there are ' + name.length.to_s + ' characters in your name, ' + name + '?'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      No, I did not know that.  <strong>Note:</strong>  that's the number of
      <em>characters</em> in my name, not the number of <em>letters</em>
      (count 'em).  I guess we could write a program which
      asks for your first, middle, and last names individually, and then
      adds those lengths together... hey, why don't you do that!  Go ahead,
      I'll wait.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Did you do it?  Good!  It's nice to program, isn't it?
      After a few more chapters, though, you'll be amazed at
      what you can do.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So, there are also a number of string methods which change the case
      (uppercase and lowercase) of your string.  #{code 'upcase'} changes
      every lowercase letter to uppercase, and #{code 'downcase'} changes
      every uppercase letter to lowercase.  #{code 'swapcase'} switches
      the case of every letter in the string, and finally, #{code 'capitalize'}
      is just like #{code 'downcase'}, except that it switches the first
      character to uppercase (if it is a letter).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      letters = 'aAbBcCdDeE'
      puts letters.upcase
      puts letters.downcase
      puts letters.swapcase
      puts letters.capitalize
      puts ' a'.capitalize
      puts letters
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Pretty standard stuff.  As you can see from the line
      #{code "puts ' a'.capitalize"}, the method #{code 'capitalize'}
      only capitalizes the first <em>character</em>, not the first
      <em>letter</em>.  Also, as we have seen before, throughout all of
      these method calls, #{code 'letters'} remains unchanged.  I don't mean
      to belabor the point, but it's important to understand.  There are
      some methods which <em>do</em> change the associated object, but we haven't
      seen any yet, and we won't for some time.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The last of the fancy string methods we'll look at
      are for visual formatting.
      The first one, #{code 'center'}, adds spaces to the beginning and
      end of the string to make it centered.  However, just like you have
      to tell #{code 'puts'} what you want it to print, and #{code '+'}
      what you want it to add, you have to tell #{code 'center'} how
      wide you want your centered string to be.  So if I wanted to center
      the lines of a poem, I would do it like this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      lineWidth = 50
      puts(                'Old Mother Hubbard'.center(lineWidth))
      puts(               'Sat in her cupboard'.center(lineWidth))
      puts(         'Eating her curds an whey,'.center(lineWidth))
      puts(          'When along came a spider'.center(lineWidth))
      puts(         'Which sat down beside her'.center(lineWidth))
      puts('And scared her poor shoe dog away.'.center(lineWidth))
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Hmmm... I don't think that's how that nursery rhyme goes, but I'm
      too lazy to look it up.  (Also, I wanted to line up the
      #{code '.center lineWidth'} part, so I put in those extra spaces
      before the strings.  This is just because I think it is prettier
      that way.  Programmers often have strong feelings about what is pretty
      in a program, and they often disagree about it.  The more you
      program, the more you will come into your own style.)  Speaking of
      being lazy, laziness isn't always
      a bad thing in programming.  For example, see how I stored the
      width of the poem in the variable #{code 'lineWidth'}?  This was so that
      if I want to go back later and make the poem wider, I only have to
      change the very top line of the program, instead of every line which
      does centering.  With a very long poem, this could save me a lot of
      time.  That kind of laziness is really a virtue in programming.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So, about that centering... you may have noticed that it isn't quite
      as beautiful as what a word processor would have done.  If you really
      want perfect centering (and maybe a nicer font), then you should just use
      a word processor!  Ruby is a wonderful tool, but no tool is the right
      tool for <em>every</em> job.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The other two string formatting methods are #{code 'ljust'} and
      #{code 'rjust'}, which stand for <dfn>left justify</dfn> and
      <dfn>right justify</dfn>.  They are similar to #{code 'center'}, except
      that they pad the string with spaces on the right and left sides,
      respectively.  Let's take a look at all three in action:
      END_PARAGRAPH

      There aren't nearly as many number methods as there are string methods
      (though I still don't know them all off the top of my head).  Here, we'll

      methods.

      The other two arithmetic methods are #{code '**'} (exponentiation)
      and #{code '%'} (modulus).  So if you want to say "five squared"
      in Ruby, you would write it as #{code '5**2'}.  You can also use
      floats for your exponent, so if you want the square root of 5, you
      could write #{code '5**0.5'}.  The modulus method gives you the remainder
      after division by a number.  So, for example, if I divide 7 by 3,
      I get 2 with a remainder of 1.  Let's see it working in a program:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 5**2
      puts 5**0.5

      From that last line, we learn that a (non-leap) year has some number
      of weeks, plus one day.  So if your birthday was on a Tuesday this year,
      it will be on a Wednesday next year.  You can also use floats with the modulus
      method.  Basically, it works the only sensible way it could... but I'll
      let you play around with that.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end

      There's one last method to mention before we check out the random number

      Ruby comes with a pretty nice random number generator.  The method to get
      a randomly chosen number is #{code 'rand'}.  If you call #{code 'rand'} just like
      that, you'll get a float greater than or equal to #{code '0.0'} and less
      than #{code '1.0'}.  If you give #{code 'rand'} an integer (#{code '5'}
      for example), it will give you an integer greater than or equal to
      #{code '0'} and less than #{code '5'} (so five possible numbers,
      from #{code '0'} to #{code '4'}).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end

      Let's see #{code 'rand'} in action.  (If you reload this page, these numbers will
      change each time.  You did know I was actually running these programs, didn't you?)

      Note that I used #{code 'rand(101)'} to get back numbers from #{code '0'}
      to #{code '100'}, and that #{code 'rand(1)'} always
      gives back #{code '0'}.  Not understanding the range of possible return
      values is the biggest mistake I see people make with #{code 'rand'}; even professional
      programmers; even in finished products you can buy at the store.  I even
      had a CD player once which, if set on "Random Play," would play every song but
      the last one...  (I wonder what would have happened if I had put in a CD with
      only one song on it?)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Sometimes you might want #{code 'rand'} to return the <em>same</em> random numbers
      in the same sequence on two different runs of your program.  (For example, once I
      was using randomly generated numbers to create a randomly generated world for a computer
      game.  If I found a world that I really liked, perhaps I would want to play on it
      again, or send it to a friend.)  In order to do this, you need to set the
      <em>seed</em>, which you can do with #{code 'srand'}.  Like this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      srand 1776
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      puts ''
      srand 1776
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      puts(rand(100))
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      It will do the same thing every time you seed it with the same number.  If you want
      to get different numbers again (like what happens if you never use
      #{code 'srand'}), then just call #{code 'srand 0'}.  This seeds it with a
      really weird number, using (among other things) the current time on
      your computer, down to the millisecond.

    h2 {"The #{code 'Math'} Object"}

      Finally, let's look at the #{code 'Math'} object.  We might as well

      puts(Math::PI)
      puts(Math::E)
      puts(Math.cos(Math::PI/3))

      puts(Math.log(Math::E**2))
      puts((1 + Math.sqrt(5))/2)
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The first thing you noticed was probably the #{code '::'}
      notation.  Explaining the <dfn>scope operator</dfn> (which is what that is)
      is really beyond the, uh... scope of this tutorial.  No pun
      intended.  I swear.  Suffice it to say, you can use
      #{code 'Math::PI'} just like you would expect to.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      As you can see, #{code 'Math'} has all of the things you would

  #
  
  def generateFlowControl
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Ahhhh, flow control.  This is where it all comes together.  Even though
      this chapter is shorter and easier than the #{makeLink 'methods', :generateMethods}
      chapter, it will open up a whole world of programming possibilities.
      After this chapter, we'll be able to write truly interactive
      programs; in the past we have made programs which <em>say</em> different
      things depending on your keyboard input, but after this chapter
      they will actually <em>do</em> different things, too.  But
      before we can do that, we need to be
      able to compare the objects in our programs.  We need...
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Comparison Methods'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Let's rush through this part so we can get to the next
      section, <strong>Branching</strong>, where all the cool
      stuff happens.  So, to see if one object is greater than
      or less than another, we use the methods #{code '>'}
      and #{code '<'}, like this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 1 > 2
      puts 1 < 2
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      No problem.  Likewise, we can find out if an object is
      greater-than-or-equal-to another (or less-than-or-equal-to)
      with the methods #{code '>='} and #{code '<='}
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 5 >= 5
      puts 5 <= 4
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And finally, we can see if two objects are equal or not
      using #{code '=='} (which means "are these equal?")
      and #{code '!='} (which means "are these different?").
      It's important not to confuse #{code '='} with #{code '=='}.
      #{code '='} is for telling a variable to point at an object
      (assignment), and #{code '=='} is for asking the question:  "Are
      these two objects equal?"
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 1 == 1
      puts 2 != 1
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Of course, we can compare strings, too.  When strings
      get compared, they compare their <dfn>lexicographical ordering</dfn>,
      which basically means their dictionary ordering.  #{code 'cat'}
      comes before #{code 'dog'} in the dictionary, so:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'cat' < 'dog'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      There's a catch, though:  the way computers usually do things,
      they order capital letters as coming before lowercase letters.
      (That's how they store the letters in fonts, for example:
      all the capital letters first, then the lowercase ones.)
      This means that it will think #{code "'Zoo'"} comes before #{code "'ant'"}, so if you
      want to figure out which word would come first in a real dictionary,
      make sure to use #{code 'downcase'} (or #{code 'upcase'} or
      #{code 'capitalize'}) on both words before you try to compare them.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      One last note before <strong>Branching</strong>:  The comparison
      methods aren't giving us the strings #{code "'true'"} and
      #{code "'false'"}; they are giving us the special objects #{code 'true'} and
      #{code 'false'}.  (Of course, #{code 'true.to_s'} gives us
      #{code "'true'"}, which is why #{code 'puts'} printed #{code "'true'"}.)
      #{code 'true'} and #{code 'false'} are used all the time in...
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Branching'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Branching is a simple concept, but powerful.  In fact, it's so simple
      that I bet I don't even have to explain it at all; I'll just show you:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    run1 = {:input => ['Chris']}
    run2 = {:input => ['Chewbacca'], :remark => 'But if we put in a different name...'}
    progN run1, run2 do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello, what\\'s your name?'
      name = gets.chomp
      puts 'Hello, ' + name + '.'
      if name == 'Chris'
        puts 'What a lovely name!'
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And that is branching.  If what comes after the #{code 'if'} is
      #{code 'true'}, we run the code between the
      #{code 'if'} and the #{code 'end'}.  If what comes after the
      #{code 'if'} is #{code 'false'}, we don't.  Plain and simple.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      I indented the code between the #{code 'if'} and the #{code 'end'}
      just because I think it's easier to keep track of the
      branching that way.  Almost all
      programmers do this, regardless of what language they are
      programming in.  It may not seem much help in this simple
      example, but when things get more complex, it makes a big
      difference.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Often, we would like a program to do one thing if an expression
      is #{code 'true'}, and another if it is #{code 'false'}.  That's
      what #{code 'else'} is for:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    run1 = {:input => ['Chris']}
    run2 = {:input => ['Ringo'], :remark => 'Now let\'s try a different name...'}
    progN run1, run2 do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'I am a fortune-teller.  Tell me your name:'
      name = gets.chomp
      if name == 'Chris'
        puts 'I see great things in your future.'
      else
        puts 'Your future is... Oh my!  Look at the time!'
        puts 'I really have to go, sorry!'
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Branching is kind of like coming to a fork in the code:  Do
      we take the path for people whose #{code "name == 'Chris'"},
      or #{code 'else'} do we take the other path?
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And just like the branches of a tree, you can have branches
      which themselves have branches:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    run1 = {:input => ['chris', 'yes']}
    run2 = {:input => ['Chris'], :remark => 'Fine, I\'ll capitalize it...'}
    progN run1, run2 do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello, and welcome to 7th grade English.'
      puts 'My name is Mrs. Gabbard.  And your name is...?'
      name = gets.chomp
      
      if name == name.capitalize
        puts 'Please take a seat, ' + name + '.'
      else
        puts name + '?  You mean ' + name.capitalize + ', right?'
        puts 'Don\\'t you even know how to spell your name??'
        reply = gets.chomp
        
        if reply.downcase == 'yes'
          puts 'Hmmph!  Well, sit down!'
        else
          puts 'GET OUT!!'
        end
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Sometimes it might get confusing trying to figure out
      where all of the #{code 'if'}s, #{code 'else'}s, and
      #{code 'end'}s go.  What I do is write the #{code 'end'}
      <em>at the same time</em> I write the #{code 'if'}.  So
      as I was writing the above program, this is how it looked
      first:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog false do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello, and welcome to 7th grade English.'
      puts 'My name is Mrs. Gabbard.  And your name is...?'
      name = gets.chomp
      
      if name == name.capitalize
      else
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Then I filled it in with <dfn>comments</dfn>, stuff
      in the code the computer will ignore:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog false do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello, and welcome to 7th grade English.'
      puts 'My name is Mrs. Gabbard.  And your name is...?'
      name = gets.chomp
      
      if name == name.capitalize
        #  She's civil.
      else
        #  She gets mad.
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Anything after a #{code '#'} is
      considered a comment (unless, of course, you
      are in a string).  After that, I replaced the comments
      with working code.  Some people like to leave the comments
      in; personally, I think well-written code usually speaks
      for itself.  I used to use more comments, but the more
      "fluent" in Ruby I become, the less I use them.  I actually
      find them distracting much of the time.  It's a personal
      choice; you'll find your own (usually evolving) style.
      So my next step looked like this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog false do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello, and welcome to 7th grade English.'
      puts 'My name is Mrs. Gabbard.  And your name is...?'
      name = gets.chomp
      
      if name == name.capitalize
        puts 'Please take a seat, ' + name + '.'
      else
        puts name + '?  You mean ' + name.capitalize + ', right?'
        puts 'Don\\'t you even know how to spell your name??'
        reply = gets.chomp
        
        if reply.downcase == 'yes'
        else
        end
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Again, I wrote down the #{code 'if'}, #{code 'else'}, and
      #{code 'end'} all at the same time.  It really helps me keep
      track of "where I am" in the code.  It also makes the job
      seem easier because I can focus on one small part, like
      filling in the code between the #{code 'if'} and the
      #{code 'else'}.  The other benefit of doing it this way
      is that the computer can understand the program at any
      stage.  Every one of the unfinished versions of the
      program I showed you would run.  They weren't finished,
      but they were working programs.  That way I could test it
      as I wrote it, which helped to see how it was coming along
      and where it still needed work.  When it passed all
      of the tests, that's how I knew I was done!
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      These tips will help you write programs with branching,
      but they also help with the other main type of flow control:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Looping'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Often, you'll want your computer to do the same thing over and
      over again&mdash;after all, that's what computers are supposed to
      be so good at.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      When you tell your computer to keep repeating something,
      you also need to tell it when to stop.  Computers never get bored,
      so if you don't tell it to stop, it won't.  We make sure this
      doesn't happen by telling the computer to repeat certain parts
      of a program #{code 'while'} a certain condition is true.  This
      works very similarly to how #{code 'if'} works:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Hello?', 'Hi!', 'Very nice to meet you.', 'Oh... how sweet!', 'bye'] do <<-END_CODE
      command = ''
      
      while command != 'bye'
        puts command
        command = gets.chomp
      end
      
      puts 'Come again soon!'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And that's a loop.  (You may have noticed the blank line at the
      beginning of the output; it's from the first #{code 'puts'}, before
      the first #{code 'gets'}.  How would you change the program to get
      rid of this first line.  Test it!  Did it work <em>exactly</em>
      like the program above, other than that first blank line?)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Loops allow you to do all kinds of interesting things, as I'm sure
      you can imagine.  However, they can also cause problems if you
      make a mistake.  What if your computer gets trapped in an infinite
      loop?  If you think this may have happened, just hold down the
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and press <kbd>C</kbd>.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Before we start playing around with loops, though,
      let's learn a few things to make our job easier.

      Let's take a look at our first branching program again.  What if
      my wife came home, saw the program, tried it out, and it didn't
      tell her what a lovely name <em>she</em> had?  I wouldn't want to
      hurt her feelings (or sleep on the couch), so let's rewrite it:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Katy'] do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello, what\\'s your name?'
      name = gets.chomp
      puts 'Hello, ' + name + '.'
      if name == 'Chris'
        puts 'What a lovely name!'
      else
        if name == 'Katy'
          puts 'What a lovely name!'
        end
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Well, it works... but it isn't a very pretty program.  Why not?
      Well, the best
      rule I ever learned in programming was the <dfn>DRY</dfn> rule:
      <dfn>Don't Repeat Yourself</dfn>.  I could probably write a small
      book just on why that is such a good rule.  In our case, we
      repeated the line #{code "puts 'What a lovely name!'"}.  Why is
      this such a big deal?  Well, what if I made a spelling mistake
      when I rewrote it?  What if I wanted to change it from
      #{code "'lovely'"} to #{code "'beautiful'"} on both lines?
      I'm lazy, remember?  Basically, if
      I want the program to do the same thing when it gets
      #{code "'Chris'"} or #{code "'Katy'"}, then it should really
      <em>do the same thing</em>:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog ['Katy'] do <<-END_CODE
      puts 'Hello, what\\'s your name?'
      name = gets.chomp
      puts 'Hello, ' + name + '.'
      if (name == 'Chris' or name == 'Katy')
        puts 'What a lovely name!'
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Much better.  In order to make it work, I used #{code 'or'}.
      The other <em>logical operators</em> are #{code 'and'} and 
      #{code 'not'}.  It is always a good idea to use parentheses
      when working with these.  Let's see how they work:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      iAmChris  = true
      iAmPurple = false
      iLikeFood = true
      iEatRocks = false
      
      puts (iAmChris  and iLikeFood)
      puts (iLikeFood and iEatRocks)
      puts (iAmPurple and iLikeFood)
      puts (iAmPurple and iEatRocks)
      puts
      puts (iAmChris  or iLikeFood)
      puts (iLikeFood or iEatRocks)
      puts (iAmPurple or iLikeFood)
      puts (iAmPurple or iEatRocks)
      puts
      puts (not iAmPurple)
      puts (not iAmChris )
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The only one of these which might trick you is
      #{code 'or'}.  In English, we often use "or" to mean
      "one or the other, but not both."  For example, your
      mom might say, "For dessert, you can have pie or cake."
      She did <em>not</em> mean you could have them both!
      A computer, on the other hand, uses #{code 'or'} to mean "one or the other,
      or both."  (Another way of saying it is, "at least one of
      these is true.")  This is why computers are more fun than
      moms.

      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      You know, I don't think we can do it.  We need a way to store
      an unknown amount of words, and how to keep track of them all
      together, so they don't get mixed up with other variables.  We
      need to put them in some sort of a list.  We need <dfn>arrays</dfn>.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      An array is just a list in your computer.  Every slot in
      the list acts like a variable:  you can see what object
      a particular slot points to, and you can make it point to a
      different object.  Let's take a look at some arrays:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog false do <<-END_CODE
      []
      [5]
      ['Hello', 'Goodbye']
      
      flavor = 'vanilla'             #  This is not an array, of course...
      [89.9, flavor, [true, false]]  #  ...but this is.
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So first we have an empty array, then an array holding
      a single number, then an array holding two strings.
      Next, we have a simple assignment; then an
      array holding three objects, the last
      of which is the array #{code '[true, false]'}.  Remember,
      variables aren't objects, so our last array is really
      pointing to float, a <em>string</em>, and an array.  Even if we
      were to set #{code 'flavor'} to
      point to something else, that wouldn't change the
      array.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      To help us find a particular object in an array, each
      slot is given an index number.  Programmers (and, incidentally,
      most mathematicians) start counting from zero, though,
      so the first slot in the array is slot zero.  Here's
      how we would reference the objects in an array:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      names = ['Ada', 'Belle', 'Chris']
      
      puts names
      puts names[0]
      puts names[1]
      puts names[2]
      puts names[3]  #  This is out of range.
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So, we see that #{code 'puts names'} prints each name in
      the array #{code 'names'}.  Then we use #{code 'puts names[0]'}
      to print out the "first" name in the array, and
      #{code 'puts names[1]'} to print the "second"... I'm sure this seems
      confusing, but you <em>do</em> get used to it.  You just have to really
      start <em>thinking</em> that counting begins at zero, and
      stop using words like "first" and "second".
      If you go out to a five-course meal, don't talk about
      the "first" course; talk about course zero
      (and in your head, be thinking #{code 'course[0]'}).
      You have five fingers on your right hand, and their
      numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  My wife and I are
      jugglers.  When we juggle six clubs, we are juggling
      clubs 0-5.  Hopefully in the next few months, we'll
      be able to juggle club 6 (and thus be juggling seven
      clubs between us).  You'll know you've got it when you
      start using the word "zeroth".  :-) Yes, it's a real
      word; ask any programmer or mathematician.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Finally, we tried #{code 'puts names[3]'}, just to see what
      would happen.  Were you expecting an error?  Sometimes when
      you ask a question, your question doesn't make sense (at
      least to your computer); that's when you get an error.
      Sometimes, however, you can ask a question and the answer
      is <em>nothing</em>.  What's in slot three?  Nothing.
      What is #{code 'names[3]'}?  #{code 'nil'}:  Ruby's way
      of saying "nothing".  #{code 'nil'} is a special object
      which basically means "not any other object."
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      If all this funny numbering of array slots is getting to
      you, fear not!  Often, we can avoid them completely by
      using various array methods, like this one:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {"The Method #{code 'each'}"}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      #{code 'each'} allows us to do something (whatever we
      want) to #{code 'each'} object the array points to.  So, if we
      want to say something nice about each language in the array
      below, we'd do this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      languages = ['English', 'German', 'Ruby']
      
      languages.each do |lang|
        puts 'I love ' + lang + '!'
        puts 'Don\\'t you?'
      end
      
      puts 'And let\\'s hear it for C++!'
      puts '...'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So what just happened?  Well, we were able to go through
      every object in the array without using any numbers, so
      that's definitely nice.  Translating into English, the above
      program reads something like:  For #{code 'each'} object
      in #{code 'languages'}, point the variable #{code 'lang'}
      to the object and then #{code 'do'} everything I tell you to,
      until you come to the #{code 'end'}.  (Just so you know,
      C++ is another programming language.  It's much harder to
      learn than Ruby; usually, a C++ program will be many times
      longer than a Ruby program which does the same thing.)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      You might be thinking to yourself, "This is a lot like
      the loops we learned about earlier."  Yep, it's similar.
      One important difference is that the method #{code 'each'}
      is just that:  a method.  #{code 'while'} and #{code 'end'}
      (much like #{code 'do'}, #{code 'if'}, #{code 'else'}, and all the other
      <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pkeyword">#{@@KEYWORD_COLOR}</span></span>
      words) are not methods.  They are a fundamental part of the Ruby
      language, just like #{code '='} and parentheses; kind of
      like punctuation marks in English.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      But not #{code 'each'}; #{code 'each'} is just another
      array method.  Methods like #{code 'each'} which "act like"
      loops are often called <dfn>iterators</dfn>.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      One thing to notice about iterators is that they are
      always followed by #{code 'do'}...#{code 'end'}.
      #{code 'while'} and #{code 'if'} never had a #{code 'do'}
      near them; we only use #{code 'do'} with iterators.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Here's another cute little iterator, but it's not an
      array method... it's an integer method!
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE

        puts 'Hip-Hip-Hooray!'
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    h2 {'More Array Methods'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So we've learned #{code 'each'},
      but there are many other array methods... almost as
      many as there are string methods!  In fact, some of
      them (like #{code 'length'}, #{code 'reverse'},
      #{code '+'}, and #{code '*'})
      work just like they do for strings, except that they
      operate on the slots of the array rather than the
      letters of the string.  Others, like #{code 'last'}
      and #{code 'join'}, are specific to arrays.  Still
      others, like #{code 'push'} and #{code 'pop'},
      actually change the array.  And just as with
      the string methods, you don't have to remember
      all of these, as long as you can remember where to
      find out about them (right here).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      First, let's look at #{code 'to_s'} and #{code 'join'}.
      #{code 'join'} works much like #{code 'to_s'} does, except
      that it adds a string in between the array's objects.
      Let's take a look:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      foods = ['artichoke', 'brioche', 'caramel']
      
      puts foods
      puts
      puts foods.to_s
      puts
      puts foods.join(', ')
      puts
      puts foods.join('  :)  ') + '  8)'
      
      200.times do
        puts []
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      As you can see, #{code 'puts'} treats arrays differently
      from other objects:  it just calls #{code 'puts'} on each
      of the objects in the array.  That's why #{code 'puts'}ing
      an empty array 200 times doesn't do anything; the array doesn't
      point to anything, so there's nothing to #{code 'puts'}.  (Doing
      nothing 200 times is still doing nothing.)
      Try #{code 'puts'}ing an array containing other arrays;
      does it do what you expected?
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Also, did you notice that I left out the empty strings when
      I wanted to #{code 'puts'} a blank line?  It does the same
      thing.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Now let's take a look at #{code 'push'}, #{code 'pop'},
      and #{code 'last'}.  The methods #{code 'push'} and #{code 'pop'}
      are sort of opposites,
      like #{code '+'} and #{code '-'} are.  #{code 'push'} adds
      an object to the end of your array, and #{code 'pop'}
      removes the last object from the array (and tell you
      what it was).  #{code 'last'} is similar to #{code 'pop'}
      in that it tells you what's at the end of the array,
      except that it leaves the array alone.
      Again, #{code 'push'} and #{code 'pop'} <em>actually
      change the array</em>:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      favorites = []
      favorites.push 'raindrops on roses'
      favorites.push 'whiskey on kittens'
      
      puts favorites[0]
      puts favorites.last
      puts favorites.length
      
      puts favorites.pop

      Ese fue un programa bastante largo, con mucha repetici√≥n.
      (Todas las secciones de c√≥digo sobre las preguntas de comida 
      mejicana eran id√©nticas, y la pregunta sobre mojar la cama fue
      la √∫nica pregunta levemente diferente).
      La repetici√≥n es mala. Sin embargo, no podemos transformar el 
      c√≥digo en un gran bucle o iterador, porque a veces queremos 
      hacer algo entre las preguntas. En situaciones como estas, 
      lo mejor es escribir un m√©todo, como se describe a continuaci√≥n:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def decirMuu
        puts 'muuuuuuu...'
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Uh... Nuestro programa no hizo #{code 'decirMuu'}.
      Por qu√© no? Porque no le dijimos que lo hiciera.
      Le dijimos <em>c√≥mo</em> hacer #{code 'decirMuu'},
      pero nunca le dijimos realmente para <em>hacerlo</em>.
      Intentemos nuevamente:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def decirMuu
        puts 'muuuuuuu...'
      end
      
      decirMuu
      decirMuu

      decirMuu
      decirMuu
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Ahhh, mucho mejor. (S√≥lo en caso que no hables franc√©s,
      eso fue un pato franc√©s en el medio del programa. En 
      Francia, los patos dicen <em>"coin-coin"</em>.)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Entonces, <span class="L2Pkeyword">#{code 'def'}</span>inimos 
      el m√©todo #{code 'decirMuu'}.  (Tanto los nombres de m√©todo 
      como los nombres de variables empiezan en min√∫scula. 
      Pero existen excepciones, como #{code '+'} o #{code '=='}.)
      Sin embargo, los m√©todos no tendr√≠an que estar siempre 
      asociados a objetos? Bueno, en realidad s√≠, y en este caso 
      (como en #{code 'puts'} and #{code 'gets'}), el m√©todo est√° 
      asociado con el objeto que representa todo el programa. 
      En el pr√≥ximo cap√≠tulo veremos c√≥mo agregar m√©todos a otros 
      objetos. Pero antes...

      Tal vez hayas notado que para algunos m√©todos (como 
      #{code 'gets'}, #{code 'to_s'}, #{code 'reverse'}...)
      los puedes llamar en un objeto. Sin embargo, otros 
      m√©todos (como #{code '+'}, #{code '-'}, #{code 'puts'}...)
      toman <dfn>parameters</dfn> para decirle al objeto c√≥mo
      hacer el m√©todo. Por ejemplo, no dir√≠as s√≥lo
      #{code '5+'}, verdad?  Le estas diciendo a #{code '5'} que
      sume, pero no le est√°s diciendo  <em>qu√©</em> sumar.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Para agregar un par√°metro a #{code 'decirMuu'} (digamos que es 
      la cantidad de muus), dir√≠amos esto: 
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def decirMuu cantidadDeMuus
        puts 'muuuuuuu...'*cantidadDeMuus
      end
      
      decirMuu 3
      puts 'oink-oink'
      decirMuu  #  Esto deber√≠a dar un error porque falta el par√°metro. 
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      #{code 'cantidadDeMuus'} es una variable que apunta al
      par√°metro que se le pas√≥ a la funci√≥n. Lo dir√© nuevamente,
      pero es un poco confuso:  #{code 'cantidadDeMuus'} es una variable
      que apunta al par√°metro. Entonces si escribo 
      #{code 'decirMuu 3'}, entonces el par√°metro es #{code '3'},
      y la variable #{code 'cantidadDeMuus'} apunta a #{code '3'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Como pueden ver, ahora el par√°metro es <em>requerido</em>.
      Despu√©s de todo, por qu√© valor tendr√≠a que multiplicar 
      #{code 'decirMuu'} a #{code "'muuuuuuu...'"} si no le das un 
      par√°metro? La pobre computadora no lo sabe.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Si los objetos en Ruby son como nombres en ingl√©s, y los 
      m√©todos son como verbos, entonces puedes pensar en par√°metros
      como adverbios (como con #{code 'decirMuu'}, donde el par√°metro
      nos dice <em>c√≥mo</em> hacer #{code 'decirMuu'}) o a veces
      como objetos directos (como con #{code 'puts'}, donde el 
      par√°metro es <em>lo</em> que se despliega a pantalla). 
      END_PARAGRAPH

        cantVeces2 = num*2
        puts num.to_s+' duplicado es '+cantVeces2.to_s
      end
      
      duplicaEsto 44
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Las variables son #{code 'num'} y #{code 'cantVeces2'}.
      Ambas se encuentran dentro del m√©todo #{code 'duplicaEsto'}.
      Estas (y toas las otras variables que has visto hasta ahora)
      son <dfn>variables locales</dfn>.  Esto significa
      que residen dentro del m√©todo, y no existen fuera de √©l.
      Si lo intentas, obtendr√°s un error:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def duplicaEsto num
        cantVeces2 = num*2
        puts num.to_s+' duplicado es '+cantVeces2.to_s

      duplicaEsto 44
      puts cantVeces2.to_s
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Variable local no definida... De hecho, <em>s√≠</em>
      definimos esa variable local, pero no es local a donde
      intentamos usarla; es local al m√©todo.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Esto podr√≠a parecer un inconveniente, pero en realidad es
      bastante bueno. Aunque significa que no tienes acceso a 
      variables dentro de m√©todos, tambi√©n significa que √©stas
      no tienen acceso a <em>tus</em> variables, y entonces 
      no puedes romperlas:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def miniPeste var
        var = nil
        puts 'HAHA!  Romp√≠ tu variable!'
      end
      
      var = 'No puedes siquiera tocar mi variable!'
      miniPeste var
      puts var
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      En realidad hay <em>dos</em> variables en ese programita 
      llamado #{code 'var'}:  uno dentro de #{code 'miniPeste'},
      y otro fuera de √©l. Cuando llamamos a #{code 'miniPeste var'},
      en realidad s√≥lo pasamos la cadena de caracteres de un 
      #{code 'var'} al otro, para que ambas apunten a la misma
      cadena de caracteres. 
      Entonces #{code 'miniPeste'} apuntaba a su propio 
      #{code 'var'} <em>local</em> a #{code 'nil'}, pero eso no hizo 
      nada a la #{code 'var'} fuera del m√©todo. 
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Valores de Retorno'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Tal vez hayas notado que algunos m√©todos devuelven algo 
      cuando los llamas. Por ejemplo, #{code 'gets'}
      <dfn>returns</dfn> (devuelve) una cadena de caracteres 
      (la que escribiste), y el m√©todo #{code '+'} en #{code '5+3'}, 
      (que es en realidad #{code '5.+(3)'}) devuelve #{code '8'}. Los
      m√©todos aritm√©ticos para n√∫meros devuelven n√∫meros, y los 
      m√©todos aritm√©ticos para cadenas de caracteres devuelven
      cadenas de caracteres.  
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Es necesario entender la diferencia entre m√©todos que 
      devuelven un valor al m√©todo que los invoc√≥, y que tu programa 
      dirija su salida en pantalla, como lo hace  
      #{code 'puts'}.  Notar que #{code '5+3'} devuelve
      #{code '8'}; <strong>no</strong> est√° dirigiendo en pantalla
      el valor #{output '8'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Entonces, <em>qu√©</em> devuelve #{code 'puts'}?  No nos 
      import√≥ hasta ahora, pero ve√°moslo ahora:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      returnVal = puts 'Este puts devolvi√≥:'
      puts returnVal
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Entonces el primer #{code 'puts'} devolvi√≥ #{code 'nil'}.  
      Aunque no lo verificamos, el segundo #{code 'puts'} tambi√©n;
      #{code 'puts'} siempre devuelve #{code 'nil'}.  Cada m√©todo
      tiene que devolver algo, aunque sea tan s√≥lo #{code 'nil'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Toma un peque√±o descanso y escribe un programa para 
      averiguar qu√© devolvi√≥ #{code 'decirMuu'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Te sorprendiste? Bueno, esto funciona as√≠: el valor que 
      devuelve un m√©todo es simplemente la √∫ltima l√≠nea del m√©todo.
      En el caso de #{code 'decirMuu'}, significa que devuelve 
      #{code "puts 'muuuuuuu...'*cantidadDeMuus"}, que es
      justamente #{code 'nil'} dado que #{code 'puts'} devuelve 
      siempre #{code 'nil'}. Si quisi√©ramos que todos nuestros 
      m√©todos devolvieran la cadena #{code "'submarino amarillo'"}, 
      s√≥lo tendr√≠amos que ingresar <em>eso mismo</em> al final de 
      ellos: 
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def decirMuu cantidadDeMuus
        puts 'muuuuuuu...'*cantidadDeMuus
        'submarino amarillo'
      end
      
      x = decirMuu 2
      puts x
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Entonces, intentemos el experimento psicol√≥gico nuevamente,
      pero esta vez escribiremos un m√©todo que haga las preguntas 
      por nosotros.
      Este m√©todo necesitar√° tomar como par√°metro la pregunta, y 
      devolver #{code 'true'} si respondieron #{input 's√≠'} y 
      #{code 'false'} si respondieron #{input 'no'}.  (Aunque 
      la mayor√≠a del tiempo simplemente ignoremos la respuesta, 
      sigue siendo una buena idea que nuestro m√©todo devuelva
      la respuesta. De esta forma podremos usarlo tambi√©n para la 
      pregunta de mojar la cama.)

  #  CLASSES
  #
  
  def generateClasses
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So far we've seen several different kinds, or
      <dfn>classes</dfn>, of objects:
      strings, integers, floats, arrays, and a few special objects
      (#{code 'true'}, #{code 'false'}, and #{code 'nil'}) which
      we'll talk about later.
      In Ruby, these classes are always capitalized:  #{code 'String'},
      #{code 'Integer'}, #{code 'Float'}, #{code 'Array'}... etc.
      In general, if we want to create a new object of a
      certain class, we use #{code 'new'}:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      a = Array.new  + [12345]  #  Array  addition.
      b = String.new + 'hello'  #  String addition.
      c = Time.new
      
      puts 'a = '+a.to_s
      puts 'b = '+b.to_s
      puts 'c = '+c.to_s
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Because we can create arrays and strings using
      #{code '[...]'} and #{code "'...'"} respectively, we rarely create
      them using #{code 'new'}.  (Though it's not really obvious
      from the above example, #{code 'String.new'} creates
      an empty string, and #{code 'Array.new'} creates an empty
      array.)  Also, numbers are special exceptions:  you can't
      create an integer with #{code 'Integer.new'}.  You just have
      to write the integer.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {"The #{code 'Time'} Class"}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So what's the story with this #{code 'Time'} class?
      #{code 'Time'} objects represent moments in time.  You can
      add (or subtract) numbers to (or from) times to get new times:
      adding #{code '1.5'} to a time makes a new time one-and-a-half
      seconds later:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      time  = Time.new   #  The moment you got this web page.
      time2 = time + 60  #  One minute later.
      
      puts time
      puts time2
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      You can also make a time for a specific moment using
      #{code 'Time.mktime'}:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      puts Time.mktime(2000, 1, 1)          #  Y2K.
      puts Time.mktime(1976, 8, 3, 10, 11)  #  When I was born.
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Notice:  that's when I was born in Pacific Daylight Savings
      Time (PDT).  When Y2K struck, though, it was Pacific
      Standard Time (PST), at least to us West Coasters.  The
      parentheses are to group the parameters to #{code 'mktime'}
      together.  The more parameters you add, the more accurate your
      time becomes.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      You can compare times using the comparison methods
      (an earlier time is <em>less than</em> a later time),
      and if you subtract one time from another, you'll get the
      number of seconds between them.  Play around with it!

      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {"The #{code 'Hash'} Class"}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Another useful class is the #{code 'Hash'} class.  Hashes
      are a lot like arrays:  they have a bunch of slots which
      can point to various objects.  However, in an array, the
      slots are lined up in a row, and each one is numbered
      (starting from zero).  In a hash, the slots aren't in
      a row (they are just sort of jumbled together), and you
      can use <em>any</em> object to refer to a slot, not just
      a number.  It's good to use hashes when you have a bunch
      of things you want to keep track of, but they don't really
      fit into an ordered list.  For example, the colors I use for different
      parts of the code which created this tutorial:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      colorArray = []  #  same as Array.new
      colorHash  = {}  #  same as Hash.new
      
      colorArray[0]         = '#{@@STRING_COLOR}'
      colorArray[1]         = '#{@@NUMBER_COLOR}'
      colorArray[2]         = '#{@@KEYWORD_COLOR}'
      colorHash['strings']  = '#{@@STRING_COLOR}'
      colorHash['numbers']  = '#{@@NUMBER_COLOR}'
      colorHash['keywords'] = '#{@@KEYWORD_COLOR}'
      
      colorArray.each do |color|
        puts color
      end
      colorHash.each do |codeType, color|
        puts codeType + ':  ' + color
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      If I use an array, I have to remember that slot #{code '0'} is for
      strings, slot #{code '1'} is for numbers, etc.  But if I use a hash, it's
      easy!  Slot #{code "'strings'"} holds the color of the strings, of course.
      Nothing to remember.  You might have noticed that when we used
      #{code 'each'}, the objects in the hash didn't come out in the same
      order we put them in.  (At least, they didn't when I wrote this.
      Maybe they did just now... you never know with hashes.)  Arrays
      are for keeping things in order, not hashes.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Though people usually use strings to name the slots in a hash, you
      could use any kind of object, even arrays and other hashes (though I can't
      think of why you would want to do this...):
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog false do <<-END_CODE
      weirdHash = Hash.new
      
      weirdHash[12] = 'monkeys'
      weirdHash[[]] = 'emptiness'
      weirdHash[Time.new] = 'no time like the present'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Hashes and arrays are good for different things; it's up
      to you to decide which one is best for a particular problem.
      END_PARAGRAPH

      At the end of the last chapter, you wrote a method to give
      the English phrase for a given integer.  It wasn't an integer
      method, though; it was just a generic "program" method.  Wouldn't
      it be nice if you could write something like #{code '22.to_eng'}
      instead of #{code 'englishNumber 22'}?  Here's how you would do
      that:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    #  HACK ALERT!!!  (I can't get to the global namespace transparently

          end
          
          english
        end
      END_CODE
    
    Integer.module_eval integerClassHack  #  This is the real method definition.
    #  The following defines a method in "another" integer class:
    #  END HACK ALERT!!!
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      class Integer
        
#{integerClassHack}
      end
      
      #  I'd better test on a couple of numbers...
      puts 5.to_eng
      puts 58.to_eng
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Well, I tested it; it seems to work.  ;)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So we defined an integer method by jumping into the
      #{code 'Integer'} class, defining the method there,
      and jumping back out.  Now all integers have this
      (somewhat incomplete) method.  In fact, if you didn't
      like the way a built-in method like
      #{code 'to_s'} worked, you could just
      redefine it in much the same way... but I don't recommend
      it!  It's best to leave the old methods alone and to
      make new ones when you want to do something new.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So... confused yet?  Let me go over that last program
      some more.  So far, whenever we executed any code or
      defined any methods, we did it in the default
      "program" object.  In our last program, we left that
      object for the first time and went into the class
      #{code 'Integer'}.  We defined a method there (which
      makes it an integer method) and all integers can
      use it.  Inside that method we use #{code 'self'}
      to refer to the object (the integer) using the method.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 {'Creating Classes'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      We've seen a number of different classes of objects.
      However, it's easy to come up with kinds of objects
      that Ruby doesn't have.  Luckily, creating a new
      class is as easy as extending an old one.  Let's say
      we wanted to make some dice in Ruby.  Here's how we
      could make the Die class:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      class Die
        
        def roll
          1 + rand(6)
        end
        
      end
      
      #  Let's make a couple of dice...
      dice = [Die.new, Die.new]
      
      #  ...and roll them.
      dice.each do |die|
        puts die.roll
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      (If you skipped the section on random numbers,
      #{code 'rand(6)'} just gives a random number between
      #{code '0'} and #{code '5'}.)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And that's it!  Objects of our very own.  Roll the dice
      a few times (with your reload button) and watch what
      turns up.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      We can define
      all sorts of methods for our objects... but there's
      something missing.  Working with these objects feels
      a lot like programming before we learned about
      variables.  Look at our dice, for example.  We can
      roll them, and each time we do they give us a different
      number.  But if we wanted to hang on to that number, we
      would have to create a variable to point to the number.
      It seems like any decent die should be able to <em>have</em>
      a number, and that rolling the die should change the number.
      If we keep track of the die, we shouldn't also have to keep track
      of the number it is showing.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end

      However, if we try to store the number we rolled in a (local)
      variable in #{code 'roll'}, it will be gone as soon as
      #{code 'roll'} is finished.  We need to store the number in
      a different kind of variable:
      END_PARAGRAPH

    h2 {'Instance Variables'}
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Normally when we want to talk about a string, we will just
      call it a <dfn>string</dfn>.  However, we could also call
      it a <dfn>string object</dfn>.  Sometimes programmers might
      call it <dfn>an instance of the class #{code 'String'}</dfn>, but this
      is just a fancy (and rather long-winded) way of saying
      <dfn>string</dfn>.  An <dfn>instance</dfn> of a class is just an
      object of that class.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So instance variables are just an object's variables.  A
      method's local variables last until the method is finished.
      An object's instance variables, on the other hand, will
      last as long as the object does.  To tell instance variables
      from local variables, they have #{code '@'} in front of
      their names:

      Our dice are just about perfect.  The only thing that
      might be missing is a way to set which side of a die
      is showing... why don't you write a #{code 'cheat'}
      method which does just that!  Come back when you're
      done (and when you tested that it worked, of course).

      So that's some pretty cool stuff we just covered.  It's tricky,
      though, so let me give another, more interesting example.
      Let's say we want to make a simple virtual pet, a baby
      dragon.  Like most babies, it should be able to eat, sleep,
      and poop, which means we will need to be able to feed it,
      put it to bed, and take it on walks.  Internally, our dragon
      will need to keep track of if it is hungry, tired, or needs
      to go, but we won't be able to see that when we interact
      with our dragon, just like you can't ask a human baby,
      "Are you hungry?".  We'll also add a few other fun ways
      we can interact with our baby dragon, and when he is born
      we'll give him a name.  (Whatever you pass into the
      #{code 'new'} method is passed into the #{code 'initialize'}
      method for you.)  Alright, let's give it a shot:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end

      We saw a few new things in that example.  The first is
      simple:  #{code 'exit'} terminates the program right
      then and there.  The second is the word #{code 'private'}
      which we stuck right in the middle of our class definition.
      I could have left it out, but I wanted to enforce the idea
      of certain methods being things you can do to a dragon, and
      others which simply happen within the dragon.  You can think
      of these as being "under the hood":  unless you are an
      automobile mechanic, all you really need to know is the gas
      pedal, the brake pedal, and the steering wheel.  A programmer
      might call those the <dfn>public interface</dfn> to your car.
      How your airbag knows when to deploy, however, is internal to
      the car; the typical user (driver) doesn't need to know about
      this.
      END_PARAGRAPH

    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Actually, for a bit more concrete example along those lines,
      let's talk about how you might represent a car in a video
      game (which happens to be my line of work).  First, you would
      want to decide what you want your public interface to look like;
      in other words, which methods should people be able to call on
      one of your car objects?  Well, they need to be able to push
      the gas pedal and the brake pedal, but they would also need to
      be able to specify how hard they are pushing the pedal.  (There's
      a big difference between flooring it and tapping it.)  They would
      also need to be able to steer, and again, they would need to be
      able to say how hard they are turning the wheel.  I suppose you
      could go further and add a clutch, turn signals, rocket launcher,
      afterburner, flux capacitor, etc... it depends
      on what type of game you are making.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Internal to a car object, though, there would need to be much
      more going on; other things a car would need are a speed,
      a direction, and a position (at the most basic).  These attributes
      would be modified by pressing on the gas or brake pedals and
      turning the wheel, of course, but the user would not be able
      to set the position directly (which would be like warping).
      You might also want to keep track of skidding or damage, if
      you have caught any air, and so on.  These would all be internal
      to your car object.

      an orange tree should grow in a year), and after some number of
      years (again, your call) the tree should die.  For the first few
      years, it should not produce fruit, but after a while it should,
      and I guess that older trees produce more each year than younger
      trees... whatever you think makes most sense.  And, of course,
      you should be able to #{code 'countTheOranges'} (which returns
      the number of oranges on the tree), and #{code 'pickAnOrange'}
      (which reduces the #{code '@orangeCount'} by one and returns a
      string telling you how delicious the orange was, or else it just

      And that's just about all there is to it!  But wait a second...
      I haven't told you about any of those classes for doing things
      like sending an email, or saving and loading files on your
      computer, or how to create windows and buttons, or 3D worlds,
      or anything!  Well, there are just <em>so many</em> classes
      you can use that I can't possibly show you them all; I don't
      even know what most of them are!  What I <em>can</em> tell
      you is where to find out more about them, so you can learn
      about the ones you want to program with.  Before I send you
      off, though, there is just one more feature of Ruby you should
      know about, something most languages don't have, but which I
      simply could not live without:
      #{makeLink 'blocks and procs', :generateBlocksProcs}.

      This is definitely one of the coolest features of Ruby.  Some
      other languages have this feature, though they may call it
      something else (like <dfn>closures</dfn>), but most of the
      more popular ones don't, and it's a shame.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So what is this cool new thing?  It's the ability to take
      a <dfn>block</dfn> of code (code in between #{code 'do'}
      and #{code 'end'}), wrap it up in an object (called a
      <dfn>proc</dfn>), store it in a variable or pass it to a
      method, and run the code in the block whenever you feel
      like (more than once, if you want).  So it's kind of like
      a method itself, except that it isn't bound to an object
      (it <em>is</em> an object), and you can store it or pass
      it around like you can with any object.  I think it's example
      time:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      toast = Proc.new do
        puts 'Cheers!'
      end
      
      toast.call
      toast.call
      toast.call
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So I created a proc (which I think is supposed to be short for
      "procedure", but far more importantly, it rhymes with "block")
      which held the block of code, then I #{code 'call'}ed the proc
      three times.  As you can see, it's a lot like a method.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Actually, it's even more like a method than I have shown you, because
      blocks can take parameters:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      doYouLike = Proc.new do |aGoodThing|
        puts 'I *really* like '+aGoodThing+'!'
      end
      
      doYouLike.call 'chocolate'
      doYouLike.call 'ruby'
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Ok, so we see what blocks and procs are, and how to use them, but what's
      the point?  Why not just use methods?  Well, it's because there are some
      things you just can't do with methods.  In particular, you can't pass
      methods into other methods (but you can pass procs into methods), and methods
      can't return other methods (but they can return procs).  This is simply because
      procs are objects; methods aren't.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      (By the way, is any of this looking familiar?  Yep, you've seen blocks before... when
      you learned about iterators.  But let's talk more about that in a bit.)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    h2 { 'Methods Which Take Procs' }
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      When we pass a proc into a method, we can control how, if, or how many times we call
      the proc.  For example, let's say there's something we want to do before and after
      some code is run:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def doSelfImportantly someProc
        puts 'Everybody just HOLD ON!  I have something to do...'
        someProc.call
        puts 'Ok everyone, I\\'m done.  Go on with what you were doing.'
      end
      
      sayHello = Proc.new do
        puts 'hello'
      end
      
      sayGoodbye = Proc.new do
        puts 'goodbye'
      end
      
      doSelfImportantly sayHello
      doSelfImportantly sayGoodbye
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Maybe that doesn't appear particulary fabulous... but it is.  :-)
      It's all too common in programming to have strict requirements about what
      must be done when.  If you want to save a file, for example, you have to
      open the file, write out the information you want it to have, and then close
      the file.  If you forget to close the file, Bad Things(tm) can happen.  But
      each time you want to save or load a file, you have to do the same thing:
      open the file, do what you <em>really</em> want to do, then close the file.
      It's tedious and easy to forget.  In Ruby, saving (or loading) files works
      similarly to the code above, so you don't have to worry about anything but
      what you actually want to save (or load).  (In the next chapter I'll show you
      where to find out how to do things like save and load files.)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      You can also write methods which will determine how many times, or even
      <em>if</em> to call a proc.  Here's a method which will call the proc passed in
      about half of the time, and another which will call it twice:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def maybeDo someProc
        if rand(2) == 0
          someProc.call
        end
      end
      
      def twiceDo someProc
        someProc.call
        someProc.call
      end
      
      wink = Proc.new do
        puts '<wink>'
      end
      
      glance = Proc.new do
        puts '<glance>'
      end
      
      maybeDo wink
      maybeDo glance
      twiceDo wink
      twiceDo glance
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      (If you reload this page a few times, you'll see the output change.)  These are some of
      the more common uses of procs which enable us to do things we simply could not have done
      using methods alone.  Sure, you could write a method to wink twice, but you couldn't write
      one to just do <em>something</em> twice!
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Before we move on, let's look at one last example.  So far the procs
      we have passed in have been fairly similar to each other.  This time
      they will be quite different, so you can see how much such a method
      depends on the procs passed into it.  Our
      method will take some object and a proc, and will call the proc
      on that object.  If the proc returns false, we quit; otherwise

      The #{code 'inspect'} method is a lot like #{code 'to_s'}, except

      array returned by our first call to #{code 'doUntilFalse'}.  Also, you might
      notice that we never actually squared that #{code '0'} on the end of that
      array, but since #{code '0'} squared is still just #{code '0'}, we didn't have to.
      And since #{code 'alwaysFalse'} was, you know, always #{code 'false'},
      #{code 'doUntilFalse'} didn't do anything at all the second time we

      One of the other cool things you can do with procs is to create

      programming power (things with impressive names, like
      <dfn>lazy evaluation</dfn>, <dfn>infinite data structures</dfn>,
      and <dfn>currying</dfn>),
      but the fact is that I almost never do this in practice, nor
      can I remember seeing anyone else do this in their code.  I think
      it's the kind of thing you don't usually end up having to do in Ruby,
      or maybe Ruby just encourages you to find other solutions; I don't

      Ok, so this has been sort of academically interesting, but also
      sort of a hassle to use.  A lot of the problem is that there are
      three steps you have to go through (defining the method, making
      the proc, and calling the method with the proc), when it sort of
      feels like there should only be two (defining the method, and
      passing the <em>block</em> right into the method, without using
      a proc at all), since most of the time you don't want to use the
      proc/block after you pass it into the method.  Well, wouldn't you
      know, Ruby has it all figured out for us!  In fact, you've already
      been doing it every time you use iterators.
      END_PARAGRAPH

            if isEven
              wasABlock_nowAProc.call object

      ['apple', 'bad apple', 'cherry', 'durian'].eachEven do |fruit|
        puts 'Yum!  I just love '+fruit+' pies, don\\'t you?'

    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      So to pass in a block to #{code 'eachEven'}, all we had to do was stick
      the block after the method.  You can pass a block into any method this
      way, though many methods will just ignore the block.  In order to make
      your method <em>not</em> ignore the block, but grab it and turn it into
      a proc, put the name of the proc at the end of your method's parameter
      list, preceded by an ampersand (#{code '&'}).  So that part is a little
      tricky, but not too bad, and you only have to do that once (when you
      define the method).  Then you can use the method over and over again,
      just like the built-in methods which take blocks, like #{code 'each'}
      and #{code 'times'}.  (Remember #{code '5.times do'}...?)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      If you get confused, just remember what #{code 'eachEven'} is supposed to do:  call
      the block passed in with every other element in the array.  Once
      you've written it and it works, you don't need to think about what it's
      actually doing under the hood ("which block is called when??"); in
      fact, that's exactly <em>why</em> we write methods like this:  so we
      never have to think about how they work again.  We just use them.

      I remember one time I wanted to be able to time how long different
      sections of a program were taking.  (This is also known as
      <dfn>profiling</dfn> the code.)  So I wrote a method which takes
      the time before running the code, then it runs it, then it takes
      the time again at the end and figures out the difference.  I can't
      find the code right now, but I don't need it; it probably
      went something like this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def profile descriptionOfBlock, &block
        startTime = Time.now
        
        block.call
        
        duration = Time.now - startTime
        
        puts descriptionOfBlock+':  '+duration.to_s+' seconds'
      end
      
      profile '25000 doublings' do
        number = 1
        
        25000.times do
          number = number + number
        end
        
        puts number.to_s.length.to_s+' digits'  #  That is, the number of digits in this HUGE number.
      end
      
      profile 'count to a million' do
        number = 0
        
        1000000.times do
          number = number + 1
        end
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      How simple!  How elegant!  With that tiny method,
      I can now easily time any section of any program that I want to; I
      just throw the code in a block and send it to #{code 'profile'}.
      What could be simpler?  In most languages, I would have to explicitly
      add that timing code (the stuff in #{code 'profile'}) around every
      section which I wanted to time.  In Ruby, however, I get to keep it
      all in one place, and (more importantly) out of my way!

      (sort of) like a grandfather clock.  Test your method
      out with a few different blocks (including the one I just gave you).
      <em><strong>Hint:</strong>  You can use
      </em>#{code 'Time.now.hour'}<em> to get the current hour.
      However, this returns a number between </em>#{code '0'}<em> and </em>#{code '23'}<em>,

      &bull; <em>Program Logger</em>.  Write a method called #{code 'log'}, which
      takes a string description of a block and, of course, a block.  Similar to
      #{code 'doSelfImportantly'}, it should #{code 'puts'} a string telling
      that it has started the block, and another string at the end telling you
      that it has finished the block, and also telling you what the block returned.
      Test your method by sending it a code block.  Inside the block, put <em>another</em>
      call to #{code 'log'}, passing another block to it.  (This is called
      <dfn>nesting</dfn>.)  In other words, your output should look something like this:

      of hard to read, and it would just get worse the more you used it.  It would
      be so much easier to read if it indented the lines in the inner blocks.  To
      do this, you'll need to keep track of how deeply nested you are every time
      the logger wants to write something.  To do this, use a <dfn>global variable</dfn>,
      a variable you can see from anywhere in your code.  To make a global variable,
      just precede your variable name with #{code '$'}, like these:
      #{code '$global'}, #{code '$nestingDepth'}, and #{code '$bigTopPeeWee'}.
      In the end, your logger should output code like this:

      of this excellent book, with all of
      the latest Ruby covered, you can also get a slightly older

      That version has a nice table of contents on the side,
      as well as an index.  (ruby-doc.org has lots of other

      However, now that you are moving beyond this tutorial, you'll
      be seeing much more diverse code.  For example, I can think of
      at least five other ways to make a string (aside from surrounding
      some text in single quotes), and each one works slightly differently.
      I only showed you the simplest of the six.
      END_PARAGRAPH

      And when we talked about branching, I showed you #{code 'if'},
      but I didn't show you #{code 'unless'}.  I'll let you figure
      that one out in irb.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Another nice little shortcut you can use with #{code 'if'},
      #{code 'unless'}, and #{code 'while'}, is the cute one-line version:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      #  These words are from a program I wrote to generate
      #  English-like babble.  Cool, huh?

      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And finally, there is another way of writing methods which take blocks
      (not procs).  We saw the thing where we grabbed the block and turned
      it into a proc using the #{code '&block'} trick in your parameter list
      when you define the function.  Then, to call the block, you just use
      #{code 'block.call'}.  Well, there's a shorter way (though I personally
      find it more confusing).  Instead of this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def doItTwice(&block)
        block.call
        block.call
      end
      
      doItTwice do
        puts 'murditivent flavitemphan siresent litics'
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      ...you do this:
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    prog do <<-END_CODE
      def doItTwice
        yield
        yield
      end
      
      doItTwice do
        puts 'buritiate mustripe lablic acticise'
      end
      END_CODE
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH

              I guess this all began back in 2002.  I was thinking
              about teaching programming, and what a great language
              Ruby would be for learning how to program.  I mean, we were
              all excited about Ruby because it was powerful, elegant, and
              really just fun, but it seemed to me that it would also
              be a great way to get into programming in the first place.
              END_PARAGRAPH
            end
            para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
              Unfortunately, there wasn't much Ruby documentation
              geared for newbies at the time.  Some of us
              in the community were talking about what such a
              "Ruby for the Nuby" tutorial would
              need, and more generally, how to teach programming at all.
              The more I thought about this, the more I had to say (which
              surprised me a bit).  Finally, someone said, "Chris,
              why don't you just write a tutorial instead of talking about
              it?"  So I did.

              And it wasn't very good.  I had all these ideas that were good
              <em>in theory</em>, but the actual task of making a great
              tutorial for non-programmers was vastly more challenging than
              I had realized.  (I mean, it seemed good to me, but I already
              knew how to program.)

              What saved me was that I made it really easy for people to
              contact me, and I always tried to help people when they got
              stuck.  When I saw a lot of people getting stuck in one place,
              I'd rewrite it.  It was a lot of work, but it slowly got better
              and better.

              A couple of years later, it was getting pretty good.  :-)  So
              good, in fact, that I was ready to pronounce it finished, and
              move on to something else.  And right about then came an
              opportunity to turn the tutorial into a book.  Since it was
              already basically done, I figured this would be no problem.
              I'd just clean up a few spots, add some more exercises, maybe
              some more examples, a few more chapters, run it by 50 more
              reviewers...

              There were a few guiding principles that I tried to stick to.
              I think they make the learning process much smoother;
              learning to program is hard enough as it is.  If you're
              teaching or guiding someone on the road to hackerdom, these
              ideas might help you, too.

            end

              First, I tried to separate concepts as much as possible,
              so that the student would only have to learn
              one concept at a time.  This was difficult at first, but a little
              <em>too</em> easy after I had some practice.  Some things must be
              taught before others, but I was amazed at how little of
              a precedence hierarchy there really is.  Eventually, I just had to
              pick an order, and I tried to arrange things so that each
              new section was motivated by the previous ones.
              END_PARAGRAPH
            end
            para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
              Another principle I've kept in mind is to teach only one way
              to do something.  It's an obvious benefit in a tutorial for
              people who have never programmed before.  For one thing,
              one way to do something is easier to learn than two.  Perhaps
              the more important benefit, though, is that the fewer things
              you teach a new programmer, the more creative and clever
              they have to be in their programming.  Since so much of programming
              is problem solving, it's crucial to encourage that as much
              as possible at every stage.
              END_PARAGRAPH
            end
            para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
              I have tried to piggy-back programming concepts onto concepts
              the new programmer already has; to present ideas in such a way
              that their intuition will carry the load, rather than the
              tutorial.  Object-Oriented programming lends itself to this
              quite well.  I was able to begin referring to "objects" and
              different "kinds of objects" pretty early in the tutorial,
              slipping those phrases in at the most innocent of moments.
              I wasn't saying anything like "everything in Ruby is an
              object," or "numbers and strings are kinds of objects,"
              because these statements really don't mean anything to
              a new programmer.  Instead, I would talk about strings
              (not "string objects"), and sometimes I would refer to
              "objects", simply meaning "the things in these programs."
              The fact that all these <em>things</em> in Ruby <em>are</em> objects
              made this sort of sneakiness on my part work so well.

              Although I wanted to avoid needless OO jargon, I wanted
              to make sure that, if they did need to learn a word, they
              learned the right one.  (I don't want them to have to learn
              it twice, right?)  So I called them "strings," not "text."  Methods
              needed to be called something, so I called them "methods."

              As far as the exercises are concerned, I think I came up
              with some good ones, but you can never have too many.
              Honestly, I bet I spent half of my time just trying to
              come up with fun, interesting exercises.
              Boring exercises absolutely kill any desire
              to program, while the perfect exercise creates an itch
              the new programmer can't help but scratch.  In short,
              you just can't spend too much time coming up with good
              exercises.

              of course.  :-)
              As such, it has some neat features.  For example, all of the
              code samples are actually being run every time you view
              the page, and the output shown is the output they generate.
              I think this is the best, easiest, and
              certainly the coolest way to make sure that all of the
              code I present works <em>exactly</em> as I say it does.
              You don't have to worry that I might have copied the output

              wrong, or forgotten to test some of the code; it's all tested
              every time you see it.  So in the section on random number
              generators, if you reload the page you will see the numbers
              change each time... <em>nice</em>.
              (I used a similar trick for the example code when writing
              the book, but it's obviously more apparent with the tutorial.)
